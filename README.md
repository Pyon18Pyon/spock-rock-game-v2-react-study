# spock-rock-game-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [spock-rock-game-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/spock-rock-game-v1-javascript-study).

## How to play?

This is similar to rock, paper, scissors but it has extra hands, lizard and spock. It was played in *The Big Bang Theory*. 
There are five icons for a user and a computer. The user will have the opportunity to click on one of these icons to select his/her weapon. Then, there will be login that will allow the computer to make a random selection and it will evaluate which player won or a tie. 
#### Rules ####
**Rock** defeats scissors & lizard\
